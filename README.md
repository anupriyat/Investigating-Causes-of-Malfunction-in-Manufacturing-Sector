# Investigating-Causes-of-Malfunction-in-Manufacturing-Sector
Investigating causes of malfunctions in technological process at one of the plants that resulted in significant increase of cost for the end product of the business

# Business Problem
Business analytics group of a manufacturing company is asked to investigate causes of malfunctions in technological process at one of the plants that result in significant increase of cost for the end product of the business.
One of suspected reasons for malfunctions is deviation of temperature in burning zone from optimal levels. The sample in the provided file contains times of malfunctions in seconds since the start of measurement and records of temperature.
Project data

# Data

The data file contains time stamps of malfunction events expressed in seconds and temperature readings at the time of each event. Temperature sensor updates readings once a minute.

# Steps

Step 1. Exploring the minute data

Step 2. Analysis of over-dispersion using Regression tests

Step 3. Analysis of distibution of variables using Kolmogorov Smirnov test and distibutions of counting processes

Step 4. Explore possible types of dependence between one-minute counts and temperatures

         a. Copula Quantile Regression
         
         b. GLM Count Regression
